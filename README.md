TempData is an ESP32/Arduino project for the LILYGO T-Display-S3 AMOLED (I know, catchy name) that can monitor and display your computer stats and show you notifications including the now playing ones.
The summary screen above shows the current usage data. You can switch to the CPU and GPU graph screens using the Print key on macOS and the Pause key on Windows. These screens show activity, memory, and power usage.

## Other screens
The project also has notifications support (as of now it's only used to warn the user they've been sitting for too long)

and now playing updates support (Mac only for now)

## Support
No warranty is given but this software has been tested and in daily usage for months now on both an AMD B550 platform and an M3 Max Mac.
